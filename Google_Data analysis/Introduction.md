## The Science of Data

* Data–a collection of facts
* Data ecosystem–The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze and share data.
* Data analysis–The collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
* Data analytics–the science of data (tools, methods, manage)
* Mentor—skill up & Sponsor—move up

* Data-driven Decision-making–using facts that have been discovered through data analysis to guide business strategy, observation + intuition + data
* Data-inspired decision-making–explores different data sources to find out what they have in common
* Computer + Brain + Skills + Traits = Job Success
* Algorithm–a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task
* Data--information--knowledge
* Entire lifecycle–planning, capture, manage, analyze, archive, destroy

## The role of data analyst

* A data Analyst is an explorer, a detective and an artist all rolled into one.
* Data scientist–creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data (create new questions using data)
* Data analyst–find solution to existing questions by analyzing data sources
* Data engineers—transform data into a useful format for analysis and give it a reliable infrastructure
* Data warehousing specialists—develop process and procedures to effectively store and organize data



> Pick specializations

* Machine learning–many decisions to make, performance 
* statistics–a few decisions under uncertainty, uncertainty
* analytics–don’t know how many decisions to make, speed, ambiguity of exploration, open ended

## Path to becoming data analyst

* Blend personal side with technical side

* SQL based recording

* Choose a career: industry, tools, location, travel, culture

	> Every industry has the need to be addressed specifically by data analysts

	> e.g. Finance, telecom, tech use data differently

* increase professional network

## Skills

* Curiosity
* Understanding context
* Having a technical mindset
* Data design
* Data strategy

 

## Analytical Skills

> Qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts

* Analytical thinking

	* Root cause

	* Gap analysis:

		a method for examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future(the difference between where you are now and where you want to be)

	* What did we miss to consider before?

* Structured thinking

	* the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options

* Visualization

* Strategy, stay focused and on track

* Problem-orientation

* Correlation, different from causation

* Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

* Actionable insights

## Data detectives

* Issue–a topic or subject to investigate
* Question–designed to discover information
* Problem–an obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out
* Business task–he question or problem data analysis answers for business

## Data and fairness

* Fairness–ensure that your analysis doesn’t create or reinforce bias, no standard definition of data

* Incomplete picture

* Fail to consider other surroundings that affect data

	> e.g. reasons for catching a certain disease in a region

* Fairness measures–social context, self-reported data to avoid racial bias, sample non-dominant to ensure sampling fairness

## Data ethics

* Data comes from people, so at the end of the day, data are people
* Have responsibility for the people that the data is representing
* Privacy
* Giving consumers more control over their data
* Ethics—well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues
* Data ethics—well-founded standards or right and wrong dictate how data is collected, shared and used
* GDPR—general data protection regulation of the European Union

## Aspects of data ethics

* Ownership—individuals own the raw data they provide and they have primary control over its usage, how it’s processed, and how it’s shared
* Transaction transparency—all data-processing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by the individual who provides their data
* Consent—an individual’s right to know explicitly details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it
* Currency—individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scales of their transactions
* Privacy—preserving a data subject’s information and activity any time a data transaction occurs
* Openness—free access, usage, and sharing of data
