## How data is generated

* A result of activity
* Different formats, types, and structures of data
	* Interviews
	* Observations
	* Forms
	* Questionnaires
	* Surveys
	* Cookies

## Data collection considerations

* Choose data sources
* Decide what data to use
* How much data to collect
* Select the right data type
* Determine the time frame

## ROCCC

* Reliable
* Original
* Comprehensive
* Current
* Cited

## Glossary

* First-party data—data collected by an individual or group using their own sources
* Second-party data—data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold
* Third-party data—data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly



* Discrete data—data that is counted and has a limited number of values
* Continuous data—data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value



* Nominal data—a type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order(no sequence)
* Ordinal data—a type of qualitative data with a set order or scale



* Internal data/primary data—data that lives within a company’s own systems
* External data/secondary data—data that lives and is generated outside an organization



* Structured data—data organized in a certain format such as rows and columns (spreadsheets and relational databases)
* Unstructured data—data that is not organized in any easily identifiable manner (audio files and video file)



* Data model—a model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another
* Data elements—pieces of information, such as people’s names, account numbers, and addresses
* Data type—a specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value the data is (spreadsheets—number, text or string, boolean)



* Wide data—data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject
* Long data—data in which row is one time pointer per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows

### Open data/opennes

* make government activities more transparent, voting and local issues, improve public service, innovation and economic growth
* Data governance—a process to ensure the formal management of a company’s data assets

* Data security—protecting data from unauthorized access or corruption by adopting safety measures

## Organize Data 

* Naming conventions—consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file in its name
* Foldering–Archiving older files
* Align your naming and storage practices with your team

## Insufficient data

### Types

* Data from only one source
* Data that keeps updating
* Outdated data
* Geographically limited data

> Data integrity—the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle

> Data replication

> Data transfer—the process of copying data from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another

> Data manipulation—the process of changing data to make it more organized and easier to read

> Data validation—a tool for checking the accuracy and quality of data before adding or importing it

### Errors

> Common data errors—human error in data entry, flawed processes, system issues

> Dirty data—data that is incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant to the problem you’re trying to solve

* Spelling error
* Inconsistent formatting
* Blanks
* Duplicate

### Ways to address insufficient data

* Identify trends with the available data
* Wait for more data if time allows
* Talk with stakeholders and adjust your objective
* Look for a new dataset

## Statistics

* Population—all possible data values in a certain dataset

* Sample size—a part of a population that is representative of the population

	> [Sample Size Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html)

* Sampling bias—a sample isn’t representative of the population as a whole

* Random sampling—a way of selecting a sample from a population so that every possible type of the sample has an equal chance of being chosen

* Statistical power—the probability of getting meaningful results from a test

* Hypothesis testing—a way to see if a survey or experiment has meaningful results

* Confidence level—the probability that your sample size accurately reflects the greater population

* Margin of error—the maximum amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population (population size + sample size + confidence level)

## Analyze data for bias and credibility

* Bias—a preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing

* Data bias—a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction

* Sampling bias—a sample that isn’t representative of the population as a whole

* Observer bias/experimenter bias/researcher bias—the tendency for different people to observe things differently

* Interpretation bias—the tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way

* Confirmation bias—the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs
