## Introduction

### Definition of machine learning

>  Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.(Arthur Samuel, 1959)

### Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Supervised learning

>  used most in real-world applications, rapid advancement

>  learn from being given ‘right answers’:x(input) -> y(output label)

| Input             | Output                 | Application         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| email             | spam?                  | spam filtering      |
| audio             | text transcripts       | speech recognition  |
| English           | Spanish                | machine translation |
| ad, user info     | click?                 | online advertising  |
| image, radar info | position of other cars | self-driving cars   |
| image of phone    | defect?                | visual inspection   |

* regression
	* predict the infinitely many number of possible numbers
		* house price
* classification
	* predict categories/small number of possible outputs
		* breast cancer detection

#### Unsupervised learning

> Data only comes with inputs, but not output labels y. Algorithm has to find structure in the data.

* clustering
	* group similar data points together
		* anomaly detection
* dimensionality reduction
	* compress data using fewer numbers

#### Reinforcement learning
