## Overview

[resources](“https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/”)

* Intermediate-level survey course
* Programming and problem solving, with applications
* Algorithm: method for solving a problem
* Data structure: method to store information
	* data typea—stack, queue, bag, union-find, priority queue
	* sorting—quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, radix sorts
	* searching—BST, red-black BST, hash table
	* graphs—BFS, DFS, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra
	* strings—KMP, regular expressions, TST, Huffman, LZW
	* advanced—B-tree, suffix array, maxflow

## Why Algorithm

> Great algorithms are the poetry of computation

> An algorithm must be seen to be believed

> Algorithm + Data Structure = Programs

* To solve problems that could not otherwise be addressed
* For intellectual stimulation
* To become a proficient programmer
* They may unlock the secrets of life and of the universe

## Steps to developing a usable algorithm

* model the problem
* find an algorithm to solve it
* Fast enough? Fits in memory?
* If not, figure out why?
* Find a way to address the problem
* Iterate until satisfied
