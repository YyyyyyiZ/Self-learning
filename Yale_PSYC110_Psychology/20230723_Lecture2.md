## Sigmund Freud

* unconscious motivation—rejecting the claim that you know what you’re doing

### Three Parts

	* present at birth
	* animal part of the self
	* outrageously stupid
	* works on “The Pleasure Principle”
	* “polymorphous perversity”
* ego, 自我
	* works on “Reality Principle”
	* how to satisfy or give up on pleasures
	* the origin of consiousness
* superego, 超我
	* internalized rules of parents in society

### Five Stages of Personality Growth

* oral stage—sucking, chewing, needy
* anal stage—toilet training, compulsize, stingy
* phallic stage—“Oedipus Complex”
* latency stage
* genital stage

### Hydraulic Theory

### Defense Mechanism

> stop the id from going into consciousnes

* hide
* displacement
* sublimation
* projection
* rationalization—give a more socially acceptable explanation
* regression—act younger

### Dream

## Scientific Assessment of Freud

* falsifiability

> The more you pay for something the more you like it, the more pain you go through the more you like it

> don’t pay, make them volunteers

## Unconscious

* Why are some things unconscious?
* Why is this tiny subset of mental life conscious?

==Deception==: The best lies are the lies we tell ourselves. Certain motivations and goals are better made to be unconscious because if a person doesn’t know they have them, they won’t give them away
