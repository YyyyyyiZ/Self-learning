# Behaviorism

### B. F. Skinner

> Principle

* A strong emphasis on learning—Everything is the result of experience, no real human nature but malliable
* Against Freud—emotions, consciousness etc., can’t be counted as science
* No differences between species—study human learning by studying nonhuman animals

### Learning

#### Habituation

> A decline in the tendency to respond to stimula that are familiar due to repeated exposure

#### Classical Conditioning

> The learning of an association between one stimulus and another stimulus, conditioned stimulus and conditioned response (dog, bell, silava)

* Stimulus: events in an environment
* stimulus generaliation
* systematic desensitization

#### operant conditioning/instrumental conditioning

> reinforcement and punishment

> shaping

> reinforced intermediately

## Objections

* No innate knowledge, all you need is learning
	* Convincing evidence about inante knowledge and desire

* You could explain human psychology without mental notions like desires and goals
	* It makes sense to explain complex and intelligent behaviors in terms of internal mechanism and internal representations
* These mechanisms apply across all domains and across all species
	* can learn without reinforcement and punishment
	* natural reaction to the world

> It’s so vague as for being useless. 

> It’s trivially and uninterestingly true or scientifically robust and obviously false.
