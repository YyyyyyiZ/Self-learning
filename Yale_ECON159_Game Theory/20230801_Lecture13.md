* anticipation

	look forward to the end of the tree and walk back

* ==moral hazard==

	we keep the size of the loan small to reduce the temptation to cheat

* solutions

	* laws
	* limits/restrictions on money
	* break loan up
	* change contract to give incentive not to shirk (consider both your money and market)

* incentive design

	a smaller share of a larger pie can be bigger then a lager share of smaller pie

* incentive contracts

	* piece rates—计件制
	* share cropping—part of the output of the farm goes to land owner and pat is kept by the famer

* collateral

	gives an extra negative return to the borrower

	lower the payoff of the borrower at certain end points of the tree, end up an end up a better point

	change the choices of others in a way that helps you

* it’s crucial that the other side knows, knowledge
