## Strategic

* strategic setting–imperct competition, a setting where the outcomes that affect you depend on actions both of yours and of others
* payoff
* ==dominated strategy==–strategy $\alpha$ strictly dominates $\beta$ if the payoff of $\alpha$ is strictly greater that $\beta$ regardless of what others do
*  ==weakly dominated strategy== a player’s strategy $s^{'}_{i}$ is weakly dominated by strategy $s_i$ if

$$
U_i(s_i,s_{-i})\geqslant U_i(s^{'}_{i},s_{-i}) \quad for\ all\ s^{'}_{i}\\
U_i(s_i,s_{-i})＞ U_i(s^{'}_{i},s_{-i}) \quad for\ all\ s^{'}_{i}\\
$$

* rationality, knowledge of rationality, layers of knowledge, common knowledge(not mutual knowledge)

## Lesson

* Do not play a strictly dominated strategy(不要选择严格劣势策略)
* people choosing a dominant rational choice can lead to ourcomes that is Pareto inefficient
* payoff matters
* put yourself in other’s shoes and try to figure out what they will do—==iterative deleting dominated strategy==

## Prisoner’s Dilemma

> examples

* joint project–incentive to shirk
* price competition–incentive to undercut price
* common resources–incentive to overfish or pollute

> remedies

* joint communication
* change payoffs

## Ingredients of a game

* strategy
	* $s_i$ a paarticular strategy of player i
	* $S_i$ the set of possible strategies of player i
	* $s$ a particular play of the game
	* $s_{-i}$ choice of all except player i
	* $U_i(s_i,s_{-i})$
* payoff

==assumption: all the ingredients are known to all==
