# Repeated Interaction

> Lesson 1

* In ongoing relationships, the promise of future rewards and the threat of future punishments, may sometimes provide incentives for good behavior today. But for this to work, it helps to have a future.

* end effects
	* lame duck
	* retirement
	* economics majors’ relationships

## Game 1

* In the last round, (D, D)

## A finite game with hope of cooperation

* We’d like to sustain (A, A), but (A, A) is not a NE in one-shot game
* NE=[(B, B), (C, C)]
* We can’t sustain (A, A) in period 2
* But consider the strategy
	* play A, then
		* play C if (A, A) is played
		* play B otherwise

### SPE

* In period 2
	* after (A, A), this strategy induces (C, C)
	* after other choices, this strategy induces (B, B)
* Int the whole game

> temptation to defect today $\leqslant$ value pf reward-value of punishment tomorrow

> Lesson 2

* If a “stage game” has more than one NE, then we may be able to use the prospect of playing different equilibria tomorrow to provide incentives (rewards or punishments for cooperation today)
* There may be a problem of “renegotiation”

### Bankrutpcy

* ex-ante efficiency
* ex-post efficiency

## Grim Trigger Strategy

> Prisoner’s dilemma with a probability of $\delta$ of continuation

* play C, then
	* play C if no one plays D
	* play D otherwise

> Is grim trigger an equilibrium？

* need $1 \leqslant \frac{2}{1-\delta}\to\delta \geqslant \frac{1}{3}$

> Hoe about playing D ,and then C, and D forever?

* $(D,C), (C,D), (D,D)......\to 3-\delta$

	This defection is even worse than the defection of $D, D, D......$

* punishment $(D,D)$ forever is a SPE

> How about playing C, and then D, and D forever?

* The same analysis says it’s not profitable if $\delta \geqslant \frac{1}{3}$

> Lesson 1

* We can get cooperation in Prisoner’s Dilemma using Grim Trigger as a SPE provided $\delta \geqslant \frac{1}{3}$

> Lesson 2

* For an ongoing relationship to provide incentives for good behavior today, it helps for there to be a high probability that the relationship will continue (weight you put on).

## One-period Punishment

> What about a less draconian strategy?

* play C to start, and then
	* play C if either (C, C) or (D, D) was played last
	* play D if either (D, C) or (D, C) was played last

> Is this an SPE

> Trade off

* shorter punishments need more weight on future

## Repeated Moral Hazard

* To get good behavior, there must be a reward
* size of reward relates to probability of future continuation
