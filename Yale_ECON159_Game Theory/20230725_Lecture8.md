## Location Model

* Two towns, E, W, each holds $100^{th}$
* Two types of people, T, S, each has $100^{th}$
* strategy—choose to live in E or W

* NE
	* Two segragated NE, stable, strict
	* One integrated NE, week
	* All choose the same town and get randomized
	* individual randomization
* Tipping point
* **Lesson**
	* Seemingly irrelevant details of the game can matter. Having society randomized for you endedup better than active choice
	* “sociology”,  seeing segregation doesn’t imply people’s preference for segregation
	* policy, randomization, busing
	*  individual rndomization
* Randomized/Mixed strategies—randomization over your pure strategies

## Example

|      | R    | P    | S    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| R    | 0,0  | 1,-1 | -1,1 |
| P    | 1,-1 | 0,0  | 1,-1 |
| S    | -1,1 | 1,-1 | 0,0  |

> No NE in pure strategy

> NE: each player $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$
