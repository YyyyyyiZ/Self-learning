# Ultimatum and Bargaining

## Game 1

* 2 players
* player 1 can make a “take it or leave it” offer to player 2
* player 2 can accept the offer $\to$ (s, 1-s); player 2 can reject $\to$ (0,0)
* BI $\to$ player 2 should accept any offer

## Game 2

* 2-period bargaining
* stage 1
	* player 1 can make a “take it or leave it” offer to player 2
	* player 2 can accept the offer $\to(s_1, 1-s_1)$
	* if player 2 reject
* stage 2
	* player 2 can make a offer to player 1
	* player 1 can accept the offer $\to(s_2, \delta-s_2)$ ; player 1 can reject $\to$ (0,0)

* discount
	* $\delta<1$

## Conclude

> Alternating offer bargaining

* even split if
	* potentially can bargain forever
	* $\delta \to 1$, no discounting or rapid offers
	* same discount factor, $\delta_1=\delta_2$ (equally patient)

* the first offer is accepted (no haggling in equilibirum)
	* when assume that value of the pie and value of time are known
* the poor will do less well in bargaining
* when valuations unknown, sometimes you fail to execute a deal that’s efficient (efficient in that buyer’s valuation > seller’s valuation)
