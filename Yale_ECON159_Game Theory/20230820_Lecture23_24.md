# Asymmetric Information—Signaling

## Verifiable Information

### Cournot

* firm B has cost $c^M$
* firm A has cost $c^H=c^M+x$, $c^M$, $c^L=c^M-x$
* firm B knows its costs, firm A knows both costs
* firm A can costlessly and verifiably reveal its cost to firm B

> Informational unraveling

* If $c^L$ then reveal
* $c^M$ reveals as well to prevent being mistaken for $c^H$
* therefore $c^H$ is revealed

> Lesson 1 

The lack of a signal can be informative. “Silence speaks volumes.”

## Not Verifiable—Costly Signaling

* G-workers $\to$ productivity 50, 10%
* B-workers $\to$ productivity 30, 90%
* firms compete for workers, so
	* pay 50 to a worker identified as good
	* pay 30 to a worker identified as bad
	* pay 32 to a worker unidentifiable

### Main signal is education.(Spence)

* **MBA**, suppose that the cost per year of MBA education
	* 5, if G-worker
	* 10, if B-worker
	* not fees, not opportunity cost, but pain and suffering of work
* I claim there’s an equilibirum in which degree takes 3 years
	* G-worhers all get MBAs
	* B-workers do not
* and the employers identify
	* MBA=G-workers
	* Not MBA=B-workers

### Check the Equilibrium—Separating Equilibrium

* Need to check that no type will deviate
	* G-workers $\to$ 
		* MBA $\to$ identified as G $\to$ payoff $=50-3×5=35$
		* not MBA $\to$ identified as B $\to$ payoff $=30$
	* B-workers $\to$ 
		* MBA $\to$ identified as G $\to$ payoff $=50-3×10=20$
		* not MBA $\to$ identified as B $\to$ payoff $=30$
* Need to check that employers beliefs are consistent with equilibrium behavior

### One-year MBA

Need to check that no type will deviate

* Problem: B-workers $\to$ 
	* MBA $\to$ identified as G $\to$ payoff $=50-10=40$
	* not MBA $\to$ identified as B $\to$ payoff $=30$

* Need enough difference in cost for G to get the degree and B not want to do so

> Lesson 2 

A good signal needs to be differentially costly across types—qualification inflation

> Lesson for education

* pessimistic—no learning, only pain
* socially wasteful—send professors to drive dump trucks
* increases inequality—hurts the poor

# Auction

* Common values—value of good for sale is same for all $[v]$
* Private values—value of good is different for all and my value is irrelevant to you $[v_i]$

> oil well $\to$ homes $\to$ pure consumption goods

## Common Value Auction

* winner’s curse
	* winning bid $\gg$ true value
* payoff in this aucion
	* $v-b_i$ if you are the highest
	* $0$ otherwise
* estimate $y_i=v+\tilde{\epsilon_i}$

* suppose $b_i\approx y_i$

	$\Longrightarrow$ winner will be the $i$ whose $y_i$ is max, i.e., $\tilde{\epsilon_i}$ is max

	$\Longrightarrow$ on average, winning bid $b_i \gg v$

* If you win, you only care about how many coins are in the jar
* The **relevant estimate** when bidding is how many coins do I thinks are there given $y_i$ and given $y_i\geqslant y_j$ for all $j$

> Lesson 1

Bid as if you know you win, then you won’t regret winning.

## Types of Auction

### First-price Sealed Bid

* house

### Second-price Sealed Bid

* Vickery Auction

* the winner pays for second bid

### Ascending Open Auction

* eBay

### Descending Open Auction

* Dutch Auction

> A $＝$ D

> B $\approx$ C, difference comes when there’s a common value component, then in C you see this information, but in B you don’t

## Private Value Auction

* value $v_i$
* bid $b_i$

### B or C

payoff in this aucion

* $v_i-\bar b_j$, if $b_i$ is highest, $\bar b_j$ is the highest of other bid
* $0$, otherwise

> bid you value, $b_i=v_i$ is **weakly dominant**

### A or D

payoff in this aucion

* $v_i-b_i$, if $b_i$ is highest
* $0$, otherwise

> bid your value is **weakly dominated**

> Does FP or SP generate more value?

* independence, symmetry, private value, same revenue!
