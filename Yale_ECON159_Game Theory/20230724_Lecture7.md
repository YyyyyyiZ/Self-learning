## Bertrand Competition

> competing in prices

* players — two firms, identical product and marginal cost=$c$
* strategy — $p1, p2, 0\leqslant p_i \leqslant1$, $Q(p)=1-p$, $p$ is the lower price
* demand for firm1

$$
q_1=
\begin{cases}
1-p_1,&\text{if $p_1\leqslant p_2$}\\
0,&\text{if $p_1\geqslant p_2$}\\
\dfrac{1-p_1}{2},&\text{if $p_1=p_2$}
\end{cases}
$$

* payoffs for firm 1—$q_1p_1-q_1c=q_1(p_1-c)$

$$
BR_1(q2)=
\begin{cases}
p_1 ＞ p_,&\text{if $p_2<t c$}\\
p_1=p_2-\epsilon,&\text{if $c<p_2<p^{mon}$}\\
p_1=p^{mon},&\text{if $p_2>p^{mon}$}\\
p_1\geqslant c,&\text{if $p_2=c$}
\end{cases}
$$

> NE=$(p_1=c, p_2=c)$

> Lesson1

The outcome is like perfect competition even though there are 2 players

> Lesson2

The same setting as Cournot, but with a different strategy set, different outcome

## Differentiated Products—Linear City Model

* firms set $p_1, p_2$
* each consumer chooses the product whose total cost to her is smaller

$$
p_1+ty^2\\
p_2+t(1-y)^2
$$

> NE=$(p_1=t/2+c,p_2=t/2+c)$

## Candidate-Voter Model

* evenly distributed voters
* vote for the closest candidates
* number of candidates are not fixed
* candidates can’t choose their position, each voter is a potential candidate
* players—candidates/voters
* strategy
	* to run or not to run
	* voters vote for the closest running candidate
	* win if plurality (flip if tie)
* payoffs

$$
=
\begin{cases}
prize\ B,&\text{if win, $B\geqslant 2C$}\\
cost\ C,&\text{if running}\\
-|x-y|,&\text{if you at $x$ and winner at $y$}
\end{cases}
$$

> NE with 0 candidate, no exist

> NE with 1 candidate,  center 

> NE with 2 candiate, if equal distance from the center

> Lesson1

Many NE, not all “at center”

> Lesson2

Entry can lead to a more a more distant candidate winning

> Lesson3

If the 2 candidates are too extreme, someone in the center will enter

> Game Theory Lesson

systematic guess and check can be effective
