## Zeimelo Theorem

* 2 players
* perfect information
* a finite number of nodes
* 3 possible outcomes
	* $W_1$
	* $L_2$
	* $T$
* outcomes
	* either play Ⅰcan force a win
	* or player Ⅰ can at least force a tie
	* player Ⅱ can force a loss of player Ⅰ
* e.g.
	* NIM
	* tic-tac-toe $\to$ tie
	* ckeckers
	* chess

## Proof (by induction)

> on maximum length of game N

* N=1

	skip

* suppose the claim is true for all games of length $\leqslant\ N$, we claim it‘ll be true for games of length $N+1$

* By induction hypothesis, upper game has a solution, say  $W$, lower game has a solution $L$
* So translate the above game to:

## Example 1

* array nodes of $N×M$
* rule:  the loser is the person who ends up removing the last rock

* this game has a solution depending on $M$ and $N$

## Formal Stuff

> Defn

* A game of perfect information is one in which at each node, the player whose turn it is to move knows which node she is at and how she got here

> Defn

* A pure strategy for player i in a game of perct information is a complete plan of actions; 

	it specifies which action i will take at each of its decision node

## Example 2

> danger—finding outcomes that never be achieved

|      | l    | r    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Uu   | 2,4  | 0,2  |
| Ud   | 3,1  | 0,2  |
| Du   | 1,0  | 1,0  |
| Dd   | 1,0  | 1,0  |

## Example3

> not credible threat

<img src="C:/Users/Lenovo/AppData/Roaming/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20230803180812327.png" alt="image-20230803180812327" style="zoom:50%;" />

|      | F    | NF   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| In   | -1,0 | 1,1  |
| Out  | 0,3  | 0,3  |

* NE=(In, NF)

	(Out, F) is a NE but relies on believing an incredible threat
	
* If $\epsilon$-chance that Player Ⅱ is crazy, then he can deter entry by fighting: seemingly crazy

## Chain-store Paradox

> reputation

* small probability of crazy changes things
* reputation matters too
	* hostages: reputations of toughness
	* doctors, accountants: want reputation as good, nice, honest
