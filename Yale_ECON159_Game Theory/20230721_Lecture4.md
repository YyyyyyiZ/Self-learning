## Best Response

* Player i’ strategy $\hat{s_i}$ is a BR to the strategy $s_{-i}$ of the other players if
	$$
	U_i(\hat{s_i},s_{-i})\geqslant U_i(s_i^{'},s_{-i})
	$$
	for all $s_i$ available to player i or $\hat{s_i}$ solves
	$$
	\underset{s_i}{max}\ U_i(s_i,s_{-i})
	$$
	
* Player i’ strategy $\hat{s_i}$ is a BR to the belief p about the other players’ choices if
	$$
	E(U_i(s_i,p))\geqslant E(U_i(s_i^{'},p))
	$$
	for all $s_i$ available to player i or $\hat{s_i}$ solves
	$$
	\underset{s_i}{max}\ E(U_i(s_i,p))
	$$

* e.g.  $E(U_1(L,p))=p(l)U_1(L,l)+p(r)U_1(L,r)$

## Penalty Kick Game

|      | l    | r    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| L    | 4,-4 | 9,-9 |
| M    | 6,-6 | 6,-6 |
| R    | 9,-9 | 4,-4 |

> Lesson 1

Do not shoot to the middle

> Lesson 2

Do not choose a strategy that is never a best response to any belief

> Real Data

|      | “l”  | “r”  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| “l”  | 63.6 | 94.4 |
| “r”  | 89.5 | 43.7 |

> “l”—natural direction

## Partnership Game

> games of strategic complements

### Example

* 2 agents own aa firm jointly, share 50% profit each, each agent choose effort level to put into the firm

* Continuum strategy $S_i=[0, 4]$

* firm profit $=4(s_1+s_2+bs_1s_2)$

* payoffs
	$$
	U_1(s_1,s_2)=\dfrac{1}{2}[4(s_1+s_2+bs_1s_2)]-s_1^2\\
	U_2(s_1,s_2)=\dfrac{1}{2}[4(s_1+s_2+bs_1s_2)]-s_2^2
	$$

### Externality

* margin: I only capture $\dfrac{1}{2}$ the benefit I put in, but I absorb all the cost of the effort
* Nash Equilibrium: The players are playing at  a best reponse to each other
