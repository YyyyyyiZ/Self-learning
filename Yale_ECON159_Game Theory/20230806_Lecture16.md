## Duel

### Game

> whem, shooting, cycling, product launch

* let $p_i(d)$ be player i’s probability of hitting if i shoots at distance $d$
* assume: abilities known

> ==pre-emption==

> ==use dominance and backward induction==

* Fact A—aussming no one has thrown, if i knows (at $d$) that j will not shoot tomorrow (at $d-1$), then i shouldn’t shoot today
* Fact B—aussming no one has thrown, if i knows (at $d$) that j will shoot tomorrow (at $d-1$), then i should shoot if i’s probability of hitting $p_i(d) \geqslant 1-p_j(d-1)$, i.e., $p_i(d)+p_j(d-1)\geqslant1$

* Claim—the first shoot should occur at $d^*$

* By dominance—no one should shoot before $d^*$, but at $d^*$, there’s no dominance

> you need to know what you believe about the opponent’s next move

* By backward induction
	* At $d=0$, say play 2’s turn, shoot
	* At $d=1$, say play 1’s turn, know that player 1 will shoot tomorrow, shoot if $p_i(1)+p_j(0)\geqslant1$
	* At $d=2$, say play 2’s turn, know that player 2 will shoot tomorrow, shoot if $p_i(2)+p_j(1)\geqslant1$
	* $\cdots$

### Lesson

* Who shoots first is not necessarily better or worse shooter, but whoever’s turn it is first at $d^*$ (where $d^*$ is determined by their joint ability)

* You can solve hard problems by diminance and BI

* If playing an un-sophisticated player—still don’t shoot before $d^*$ (dominated strategy)

* people shoot early

	* overconfidence
	* pro-active bias
